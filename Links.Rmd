# TEST
Since Emmylou is a pretty smart gal, she has to stay stimulated or she will bark nonstop. Here are some of her favorite products that could be useful for other dog owners.

1. KONG Wobbler

This allows the dog to eat slower and stimulate them at the same time. So much fun for them, but does leave the floor with dog food crumbs.

2. Sensory Ball

add link

This is hands down Emmylou's favorite toy. It's super bouncy and squeaky and rattles. She doesn't tear this ball up like she tears up other toys.

3. Knee Bones

add link

These are gross and smell awful, but really do the trick. A lady at the pet store recommended them because they are easy for digestion. They last longer than products like bully sticks. 

4. "Honey" SmartPetLove Stuffed Toy

add link

This stuffed animal has been with Emmylou since we picked her up. We named her Honey. Honey sleeps with Emmylou. Usually Emmylou chews up any stuffed toy within 15 minutes, but she doesn't do that with Honey. So I think it really does comfort her. 

5. Training Treats, any brand you trust

Since Aussiedoodles are easy to train, having small treats on hand is helpful! You do not have to break them up and they are easy to bring on walks and outings. 


<!-- ### R and R-Studio -->

<!-- [R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, graphing, and lots of other stuff. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual [](). -->

<!-- ### Additional R resources -->

<!-- 1. Google is great, Google your problem -->
<!-- 2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways. -->
<!-- 3. Danielle Navarro wrote a [free Psych Stats textbook using R](https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/), it's worth checking out (some of our textbook are based on Danielle's) -->
<!-- 4. I am currently writing another stats textbook (incorporating some of the above). You can read it while it's being made right here [https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/), also check out the lab manual for more specific things about doing various stats in R (also in draft right now) [https://crumplab.github.io/statisticsLab/](https://crumplab.github.io/statisticsLab/) -->
<!-- 5. Daniell Navarro recently made this website for introducing R, it's great, check it out (also made using this R markdown process): [http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/](http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/) -->
<!-- 6. Check out my slightly older programming book that also introduces R [https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/](https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/) -->
<!-- 7. This is the definitive guide for all things R Markdown (you will find this very useful as you get better at this skill): [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) -->
